1- Consider static factory methods instead of constructors

2-A class can provide a public static factory method, which is
  simply a static method that returns an instance of the class.

3-One advantage of static factory methods is that, unlike constructors, they
  have names

4-A second advantage of static factory methods is that, unlike constructors,
  they are not required to create a new object each time theyâ€™re invoked.

5-A third advantage of static factory methods is that, unlike constructors,
  they can return an object of any subtype of their return type

6-A fourth advantage of static factory methods is that they reduce the verbosity
  of creating parameterized type instances.
